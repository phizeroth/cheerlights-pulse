# CheerLights Pulse

Simple project to pulse a [NeoPixel](https://www.adafruit.com/category/168) RGB LED with a color from the [CheerLights](https://cheerlights.com/) project. Written for the [Particle Photon](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/intro/photon/).

## Arduino compatibility
Particle uses standard Arduino language, so it should be easily adaptable to any Arduino-compatible WiFi or Ethernet board, just add your network setup and credentials and remove the Particle functions/variables.

For Particle, several console functions and variables are available for things like temporarily testing different colors.
